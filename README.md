# Securing-Medical-Data-Transfer-Using-Deep-Steganography-and-Cryptography
When handling Medical images , secure patient data transfer is paramount for maintaining trust and protecting against cyber threats. The process of deep steganography and cryptography emerges as an effective strategy to achieve this goal efficiently and comprehensively.

Workflow Overview:

Data Preprocessing (Preparation Network):
Initial processing of medical images to ensure compatibility with subsequent encryption and steganography steps.
Encryption (Cryptography):
Application of cryptographic techniques to encode medical images, ensuring confidentiality during transmission.
Image Hiding (Hiding Network):
Utilization of deep steganography to embed encrypted information within medical images, maintaining diagnostic integrity.
